# Crypto-Arbitrage
In this Challenge, I am considering arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin trades on markets across the globe, we might be able to capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations in those markets by using the powers of Pandas.

I sort through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. I will apply financial analysis to determine if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin.

This aspect of the Challenge will consist of 3 phases.

1. Collect the data.

2. Prepare the data.

3. Analyze the data.
